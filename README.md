> - This project is a web and mobile application focused on shopping cart functionality, including a payment interface and delivery tracking. It allows users to select products, add them to the cart, enter payment details, and finalize the purchase. Application developed in class to evaluate the subject "UC15 - React Native" of the Bilingual Systems Development Technician course, at SENAC - S√£o Leopoldo.

### üìã | Key Features

- **Add and Remove Items:** Users can add products to the cart, modify quantities, and remove items with confirmation alerts.
Price Calculation: The total price is automatically calculated based on the selected items and quantities in the cart.

- **Payment Details:** Users can input card details (card number, expiration date, CVV), which are formatted automatically for easy entry.

- **Local Storage for Cart:** The shopping cart data is stored using local storage (for web) or AsyncStorage (for mobile), ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **Order Confirmation:** After payment confirmation, users see a success message, the cart is cleared, and they are redirected to the home screen.

- **Order History:** Users can view their order history and check the delivery status of past orders.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is optimized for both web and mobile platforms, ensuring usability across devices.
